 325 │  -- A DSA, having received an operation from a DUA, may elect to construct a chained form of that
 326 │  -- operation to propagate to another DSA. For IN CS-4 a DSA, having received a chained form of an
 327 │  -- operation, must either process the operation or if the originating DSA is in another network, chain it
 328 │  -- to another DSA within the same network as the receiving DSA. The DSA invoking a chained form of
 329 │  -- an operation may optionally sign the argument of the operation; the DSA performing the operation,
 330 │  --if so requested, may sign the result of the operation.
