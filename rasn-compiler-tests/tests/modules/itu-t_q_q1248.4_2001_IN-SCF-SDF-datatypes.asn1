--  applies to all object-class types.
-- The information component of a value identifies the method types associated with the object-class

-- Every entry in the DIT is governed by at most one methodUse operational attribute. In addition the
-- entry is also governed by all the methodUse operation attribute defined for the superclasses of its
-- structural object class.
-- NOTE - This means that before processing an execute operation the SDF shall check the methodUse
-- attributes associated with the structural object classes which belong to the inheritance chain of the
-- entry's structural object class.
-- As a methodRule attribute is associated with a structural object class, it follows that all of the entries
-- on the same structural object class will have the same Method Use Rule regardless of the DIT structure
-- rule governing their location in the DIT and of the DIT content rule governing their contents.

-- lockSession is a mono-valued attribute that contains the name of the entry and the mono-valued
-- attribute of type boolean of this entry used to lock a dialogue to a mono-session (the timer set as temporal

-- operation is at the origin of the method invocation, the method checks first that the pointed attribute is
-- FALSE before proceeding.
-- For some security facilities, it is useful to count the number of failures and if necessary to lock the
-- facility when a threshold is reached. The two following attributes are used to store this information

SourceType ::= DistinguishedName

-- In the visited network, the source attribute will be used to store the DN of the entry of class derived
-- from stockId. In the home network, the attribute will contain the DN of an entry of class
-- securityUserInfo, the token is generated using the method defined in the fillMethodIdentifier field of

-- This Basic Service context associates an attribute value with a basic service for which the attribute
-- value is semantically valid. For example, the Basic Service context will be associated with an ISDN
-- address to indicate the type of basic service that could be used with it.  In the UPT case, this context
-- allows the definition of registration addresses for different basic services.
-- A presented value is considered to match a stored value if the context value (i.e., a basic service value)
-- in the presented value is identical to that in the stored value.
lineIdentityContext{SCF-SSF-BOUNDS:b2} CONTEXT ::= {

  ID           id-avc-assignment
}

-- The assignment context associates an attribute value with a Distinguished name (e.g. customer's
-- number or customer's name) for which the attribute value is assigned. For example, assuming that a set
-- of available resources is modelled as a multivalued attribute and customer has been designated by a
-- distinguished name, this Assignment context will be associated with the used resource to provide the
-- state of the resource (reserved) and the name of the current customer using it.
